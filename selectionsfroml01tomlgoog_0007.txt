SIGHT-READING is no longer a disputed point with
the best Latin teaehers. The time was, and not long
since, when nearly all the energy and time of the student

were devoted 'to the aequisition oi much that aided and

more 'that hindered the intellectual lire. No man could

believe more thoroughly than the editor of this book in·the

aoourate and complete study of Latin grammar in the

' preliminary work as the foundation oi future growth and

power. But he ie, nevertheless, strongly of the opinion
that there is a marked differenoe between memorizing
the grammar and knowing the grammar. There must be
constant, oareful, thorough drill in grammatioal forms,
rules, and principles But the ready application of aequired
knowledge has a twofold influenoe, -it crystalizes and oon-
denses knowledge already possessed, though perhaps in
, a dim and general form, and in addition is a valuahle
discipline in and of itself. The best Latin teaohers are
agreed, I think, that sight-reading and a re·eomposition of
’ translatione oi standard and select passages are among the

best and surest means of leading pupils into the language.
